#' A parameterized EICM model for simulation
#'
#' A parameterized EICM model ready for simulating communities with a frequency
#' distribution following a Beta distribution with shape1=1.5 and shape2=3.
#'
#' The model was generated with the command:
#' 
#' \code{truemodel <- generateEICM(32, 400, 2, 30, shape1=1.5, shape2=3)}
#' @format A 'eicm' object with 2 environmental predictors in 400 samples,
#' 32 species and 30 species interactions.
